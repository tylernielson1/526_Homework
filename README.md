# 526_Homework
### Storage for all 526 homework assignments throughout the semester.
##### Homework 1 - Personal Webpages
Create three HTML files and an associated CSS file to define three pages:

1. A personal biography

2. An online resume (basically the same as your paper resume but with hyperlinks)

3. A Portfolio describing at least three personal or class projects you have built.

These should be created to a standard that you would be comfortable showing to a perspective employer.  They should also consist of valid HTML and CSS.  Zip your files an submit them through KSOL.
